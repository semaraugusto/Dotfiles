# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for softwares I usually use. 
It's made specifically for me, I do not recommend copying without reading.
Caps Lock is inverted with Esc.
Window manager is i3 with polybar
i3 has got spotify integration

nvim and vim have many plugins. You'd have to make sure that Plug got installed and then run ":PlugInstall" on vim/neovim

Take care with the bashrc paths variables and aliases.
