# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for softwares I usually use. 
It's made specifically for me, I do not recommend copying without reading.
Caps Lock is inverted with Esc.
Window manager is xmonad with xmobar

nvim and vim have many plugins. You need Packer to use them.

Take care with the zshrc paths variables and aliases. I wasn't super careful in making this compatible to new machines
Dotfiles contain absolute paths to some directories in my computer
